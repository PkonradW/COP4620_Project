Designed for use with ANTLRv4 for a compilers class at UNF
Each "Step" folder acts as its own discrete program

* Step1: defining the grammar using ANTLR rules\n

* Step2: Adding a custom error listener and generating a parse tree using ANTLR

* Step3: Using the parse tree to construct a Symbol Table using semantic actions

* Step4: Traversing the parse tree to create executable code. employs the use of 3AC IR code constructed using an AST.
