making symbol table
implement with hash table
symboltab for each scope
add as you see declarations
can't use grammar actions
tokens become leaves in parse tree - semantic record for a token is always the text associated with that token
every symbol that shows up in a grammar becomes a leaf on the tree

Scopes
	GLOBAL for grlobe
	BLOCK<x> for blocks
	func scopes are same name as func
	func params should be included as part of scope
